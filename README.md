# eaTongV2

**Hello all ,I'm back** , I published my first version of personal website written with `next.js` ,  `mobx` , `koa` ,  `nodejs` , `mongodb` and other frontend technology for writing my blog . But a few days later ,  I realised that for my personal service , blog is only a little of all , I need `password management` `todo management` and more than a blog , also I wrote admin pages with `next.js` too , that's not so wise , and may limit my design and slow down my work . So V2 is comming , what's new in  V2?

- seperate website(with `next.js` and `bulma`) and admin ( `antd`)

- auto code generator in admin part
- auto publish production with one simple command `npm run smart-publish`
